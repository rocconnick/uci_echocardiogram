\frametitle{Introduction}
  \bangon
  \item Echocardiogram data in UCI Machine Learning Repository
  \bangon
    \item \url{http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Echocardiogram}
  \bangoff
  \gap
  \item Downloaded data, worked in git repository
    \bangon
    \item \url{https://github.com/rocconnick/uci_echocardiogram}
    \bangoff
  \gap
  \item Two notebooks, one module
    \bangon
    \item First notebook, data exploration and cleaning (\verb!initial_exploration.ipynb!)
    \item Data loading/cleaning functionality moved to module (\verb!ecg_tools.py!)
    \item Second notebook for regression model (\verb!survival_duration_regression.ipynb!)

\frametitle{Exploration and Cleaning}
  \bangon
  \item Worked in a notebook
    \bangon

    \bangoff
  \gap
  \item Problems with data:
  \bangon
    \item One bad row
    \item Many missing values
    \item Missing values mostly consistent with dataset description, but not completely
  \bangoff
  \gap
  \item Original dataset goal: predict which patients survive one year after heart attack
  \bangon
  \item One quarter of patients enrolled in study less than a year ago
  \item Only 4 of 92 remaining patients survived less than one year
  \bangoff
  \gap
  \item Instead, try to predict survival duration
  \gap
  \item Cleaning function ported from notebook to module

\frametitle{Scatter Matrix}
\begin{columns}[c]
\column{0.4\textwidth}
\bangon
\item Top row: target variable vs. each other variable
\gap
\item Not much correlation visible, anywhere really
\gap
\item Originally imagined doing dimensionality reduction, but didn't seem worth it after seeing this
\gap
\item Missing values replaced with median of distribution for that variable

\begin{frame}
\frametitle{Regression}
\bangon
\item Split data 80/20 train test
\gap
\item Tried several algorithms: least-squares, lasso, ridge, support vector, nearest-neighbor
\gap
\item Grid search for hyperparameters, 5-fold cross validation at each grid point
  \bangon
  \item Scikit-learn did the heavy lifting
  \bangoff
\gap
\item No algorithm successfully fit the \textit{training} set, let alone the test set \footnote{Nearest-neighbor just let every point be its own neighbor}
